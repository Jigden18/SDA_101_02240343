This website design focuses on creating an interactive and visually engaging user interface with a clean and modern layout. I incorporated responsive elements such as hover effects on buttons, text, and icons, along with hover-play videos for a dynamic experience. Key navigation features include a side menu with links to essential sections like Home, Apps, Discover, Learn, and Files, as well as dropdowns that provide easy access to content. I emphasized a strong visual hierarchy through custom mesh gradients, drop shadows, and interactive content boxes. Overall, this project aims to provide a seamless, user-friendly experience while showcasing advanced prototyping and design techniques.

## Main Concepts Applied
**Interactivity and User Engagement**:
- Designed buttons with hover color changes and text hover effects for responsive feedback.
- Implemented hover-play videos to create an immersive experience, allowing users to preview content without clicks.

**Navigation and Usability**:
- Created wide-screen and mini dropdowns to provide both detailed and compact views for accessibility.
- Added prototype navigation links to ensure a seamless design flow across pages.
- Developed a side menu with links to Home, Apps, Discover, Learn, and Files, making key sections easily accessible.
- Designed two containers within the Files section: one for the menu and another to display selected menu content.
- Added a darker background to active menu items to indicate selection and enhance user orientation.

**Visual Hierarchy and Aesthetics**:
- Created custom mesh gradients for a modern, vibrant look.
- Added drop shadows to content boxes for depth and emphasis.
- Designed boxes that reduce opacity on hover, adding depth and indicating interactivity.
- Created icon boxes that bulge on hover, providing tactile and visual feedback.

## New Skills and Knowledge Acquired:
- **Custom Hover Effects**: Developed color-changing and opacity-adjusting effects, enhancing my understanding of responsive UI states.
- **Prototype Navigation**: Improved my skills in linking pages within the prototype, supporting a cohesive user journey.
- **Side Menu and Dropdowns**: Learned to balance wide-screen and compact dropdown layouts, increasing my knowledge of accessible design.
- **Media Interactions**: Gained experience with hover-play video interactions, improving the prototype’s interactivity.
- **Dynamic Content Management**: Developed skills in setting up containers to display menu-specific content within the Files section.
- **Visual State Management**: Improved my use of color and contrast to indicate active states.

## Challenges Faced and Solutions:

### Hover Effect Consistency:
- **Challenge**: Ensuring button and text hover effects were consistent and non-conflicting.
- **Solution**: Used reusable components to maintain cohesion and simplify adjustments.

### Dropdown Complexity:
- **Challenge**: Designing both wide-screen and mini dropdowns required careful positioning and sizing.
- **Solution**: Used Figma’s overlays to refine dropdown sizes and placements for usability.

### Smooth Hover-Play Videos:
- **Challenge**: Ensuring smooth playback without lag on hover.
- **Solution**: Tested different interaction timings and trigger setups for seamless media play.

### Hover Opacity and Icon Bulge Effects:
- **Challenge**: Balancing the visual impact of opacity reduction and icon scaling.
- **Solution**: Experimented with opacity and scaling values to achieve a subtle, engaging effect.

### Files Section Active State:
- **Challenge**: Ensuring active menu items in the Files section were visually clear yet subtle.
- **Solution**: Used layering, tested darker background shades, and utilized Figma’s interaction settings for clarity.

In conclusion, this website design has allowed me to explore and implement a variety of interactive and aesthetic elements that enhance the user experience. By focusing on responsiveness, intuitive navigation, and dynamic visuals, I created a cohesive interface that is both functional and engaging. Through the use of hover effects, smooth transitions, and well-organized content, I aimed to make the website feel interactive and user-friendly. Overall, this project has helped me refine my skills in prototyping, visual design, and interaction, and I’m excited to continue experimenting and improving these techniques in future projects.

# REFLECTION OF PRACTICAL ASSIGNMENT III

## Main Concepts Applied 
* Usage of tailwind CSS for utility first styling `<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>`.

* I have defined custom styles for buttons and pages with `<style>` tag like .`bg-image` for full screen coverage of page background and `.mocha-green` for certain pages and button.
* Used classes like `flex`and`justify-between`classes to space elements evenly.

* Usage of `grid layout` for cards and some `hover effects like opacity change on hover`  for a user interactive display.

* I also created `collapsable elements ` which makes use of `<details>` and `<summary>` for the FAQs.

* Usage of `div` and `flex` to divide the contents and images on screen for authentic view.

* Using `grid` and `media quieries`I made the design responsive achieving visual hierarchy.

* Then there are our regular tags like `<a>`,`<img>`,`<p>`,`h1`,`<nav>`,`<footer>` and so on.

## New Skills Acquired
* I have learned how to use tailwind CSS and the proper use of utility classes.

* Using media quieries for responsive design.

* Using `grid-cols-` to specify columns for grid display.

* Making scrollabe pages.

* Using `div`for partitioning compartments for content and images .

## What I have learned ?
* We can apply styling directly to the HTML files which allows for consistency and eliminates time required for creating external CSS extensions.

* Using grid layout , flex box and media quieries for spacing elements and making the design responsive.

* Making designs interactive with hover effects and buttons .

* Organizing the contents by adding div by div to make a smooth flow of contents when scrolled.

## Some Challenges I faced
* The first challenge while creating this website was to use high quality image . I could find some of the images from the website https://www.freepik.com/.

* Since I had divided the the web page into different sections. The second challenge I faced was combing this sections and making it a scrollabe page. I overcame this problem by making all the custom styles applied under a`<style>`tag and added the code for differnt section in order enclosed in differnt `div`.

* There were other challenges like partitioning the contents and image containers(`div`) making it well spaced . To solve this I used flexbox,`flex justify-center items-center`and padding like `px-4` and `py-2`.

* Making the FAQ section interactive was another challenge. Here, I made use of `<details>`and `<summary>` tags for making the dropdown effect possible.

* Other challenge I faced was dynamic grid setup . This challenge was overcome by using the tailwind CSS's `grid grid-cols-1`and  `md:grid-cols-2` setup ensures a single-column layout on smaller devices and a two-column layout on medium screens and larger, creating a clean and balanced look.

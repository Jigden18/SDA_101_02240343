## Overview
- We replicated a news website(Bhutan Times) with a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- Included a **navigation bar with hover effects** and **interactive dropdowns** for easy navigation.
- Added a **marquee text effect** for displaying headlines in an engaging way.
- Created **interactive content boxes** that change on click, with **color contrast** to distinguish different types of content.
- Designed **buttons with hover effects** and boxes to display various types of news content.
- Used **prototyping** to navigate between different pages (Bhutan, World, Opinion, Editorial, Education, etc.).
- Each page featured a **news content box** with a **"more view"** button and a **drop shadow effect** for added vibrancy.
- Added **social media icons** and linked them using prototyping.
- Designed a **custom background** for each page and **navigation buttons** at the bottom for content exploration.

## Main Concepts Applied
- **Navigation Bar & Dropdowns**: We applied hover effects to create dynamic navigation and a smooth user experience.
- **Marquee Text**: We incorporated the marquee effect for attention-grabbing headline displays.
- **Interactive Content Boxes**: We developed content boxes that change on click with color contrast to help distinguish different sections.
- **Hover Effects on Buttons**: We added hover effects for dynamic interaction, enhancing engagement.
- **Prototyping**: We created clickable navigation between pages like Bhutan, World, Opinion, and Education for smooth transitions.
- **News Content Boxes**: We included a **"more view"** button and **drop shadow effects** for added visual appeal and clarity.
- **Social Media Icons**: We integrated social media links and made them functional within the prototype to enhance user engagement.
- **Custom Background & Navigation Buttons**: We designed a cohesive, custom background and **bottom buttons** for easy content navigation.

## New Skills and Knowledge Acquired
- **Interactive Content Design**: We learned how to create interactive content blocks and use hover effects to enhance the user experience.
- **Prototyping for Navigation**: We gained more experience in creating functional prototypes that allow users to seamlessly navigate between pages.
- **Dynamic Visual Feedback**: We improved our skills in creating dynamic visual feedback, such as hover effects and the marquee text.
- **Social Media Integration**: We developed skills in linking social media icons and buttons for seamless user interaction.
- **Content Presentation**: We enhanced our understanding of presenting content clearly using design elements like drop shadows and custom backgrounds.

## Challenges Faced and Solutions
### Hover Effects Consistency:
- **Challenge**: Ensuring hover effects were consistent across buttons, dropdowns, and content boxes.
- **Solution**: We used reusable components and tested interactions to maintain uniformity.

### Interactive Boxes:
- **Challenge**: Designing interactive boxes that felt intuitive and not overwhelming.
- **Solution**: We used color contrast and tested click interactions to create a balanced user experience.

### Prototyping Navigation:
- **Challenge**: Managing smooth transitions between pages with various types of news content.
- **Solution**: We refined interactions and ensured clear pathways with prototyping tools.

### Drop Shadow and Box Effect:
- **Challenge**: Ensuring the drop shadow effect added depth without overpowering the design.
- **Solution**: We adjusted opacity and sizes to create a subtle, vibrant effect.

### Conclusion
- This project enhanced our ability to design interactive and visually dynamic websites.
- We focused on **clear navigation**, **engaging content presentation**, and **intuitive user interactions** to create an enjoyable user experience.
- We gained experience in **prototyping**, **dynamic effects**, and **content presentation**, which will be beneficial in future design projects.

# Timetable Code Review

I created a simple HTML table displaying a timetable for first-year Software Engineering students, using basic HTML and CSS styling.

## Main Concepts I Applied
1. **HTML Table Structure**:
   - I used the `<table>` element to create a structured layout with rows and columns representing days and times.
   - `<tr>` tags define each row, `<th>` tags create header cells for days, and `<td>` tags are used for individual subjects.

2. **CSS for Styling**:
   - I applied inline CSS styles to the `<h1>`, `<td>`, and `<th>` elements to center text, set background colors, and create a color-coded look for each subject. Each subject has a unique color for quick identification.
   - I also used the `colspan` attribute in `<td>` to create a break row spanning all columns, with a distinct background color for lunchtime.

3. **Table Border and Layout Styling**:

   - By setting `border: 1px solid black;` and `border-collapse: collapse;`, I made the table borders clearly defined and prevented double borders, giving a cleaner look.
   - I also added `text-align: center;` to center the text in each cell and `padding: 25px;`to make the content more readable and evenly spaced.
4. **Class-Specific Background Colors**:

    - I applied different background colors to rows using class selectors .p and .t. This allowed me to visually separate header rows from data rows:
      - `.p`: Sets the header rows with a skyblue background color.
      - `.t`: Applies a `light purple (rgb(177, 156, 217))` background color to time slots, making it easy to distinguish times from subject details.

## New Skills and Knowledge I Acquired
- **Using HTML Table Attributes**: I learned to effectively use HTML table attributes like `align`, `colspan`, and inline CSS to make the timetable visually clear and easy to navigate.
- **Applying Inline CSS for Specific Styles**: Using inline CSS for different background colors helped me create a color-coded layout, making it easier to identify each subject at a glance.

- **Using border-collapse for Clean Layouts**: I learned the importance of `border-collapse `to avoid double borders, which makes tables look more polished and organized.
- **Applying Class Selectors in CSS**: Using class selectors like `.p `and `.t` in CSS allowed me to apply specific styles for different parts of the table, making it easy to adapt and modify sections independently.

## What I Learned
- **Importance of Accessibility and Readability**: By organizing the table and applying distinct colors for each subject, I was able to make the timetable more readable and accessible.
- **Table Alignment and Centering**: I practiced aligning the table at the center of the page using `align="center"`, ensuring it displayed properly in the layout.

- **Text Alignment and Padding in Tables**: I learned to control spacing and alignment in table cells effectively using text-align and padding, which makes tables much more readable.

- **Class-Specific Styling for Tables**: Applying unique colors to different parts of the table using classes is a great way to visually organize information.

## Challenges I Faced and How I Overcame Them
1. **Centering the Table**: At first, I had trouble centering the entire table since simply setting the alignment didnâ€™t work as expected.
   - **Solution**: I fixed this by adding `align="center"` in the `<table>` tag and ensuring the table was fully contained within the `<body>` section.

2. **Applying Background Colors to Cells**: Managing different background colors for each `<td>` cell was tricky, especially without affecting other inline styles.
   - **Solution**: I solved this by applying individual colors to each `<td>` cell for each subject, ensuring consistent display across the timetable.

3. **Challenge**: I initially struggled with borders appearing doubled or misaligned due to spacing between cells.

   - ****Solution**: I used border-collapse: collapse; to make the borders seamless and ensure the table looked neat.

4. **Challenge**: I had trouble getting the .p and .t styles to apply correctly when multiple rows shared the same class.

   - **Solution**: I ensured each <tr> or <td> had the appropriate class attribute to apply consistent styling across the table rows.

# Events List Code Review

The code generates a styled HTML page displaying a list of events with each event’s details nested in a bullet-styled unordered list.

## Main Concepts I Applied
1. **HTML Structure for Ordered and Unordered Lists**:
   - The code uses an `<ol>` (ordered list) for the main events and nested `<ul>` (unordered lists) for each event’s details, including date, venue, and time.
   - Each event title has a `class="event"` for styling the main titles, while each set of details uses `class="event-details"` for targeted CSS.

2. **CSS Styling for Readability and Visual Appeal**:
   - General styling is applied to the `<body>` and `<h1>` elements to improve readability, including background color, font family, and padding.
   - Specific styling for `.event` and `.event-details` allows for custom font size, color, and hover effects. The hover effect changes the color of event names, adding interactivity.

## New Skills and Knowledge Acquired
- **Styling Nested Lists**: I learned how to apply different styles to nested lists by using distinct classes. This allowed for separate list styles for the main events (`list-style-type: none;`) and event details (`list-style-type: circle;`).
- **Adding Hover Effects**: I experimented with hover effects by changing the color of `.event` items when hovered over, which adds a nice interactive touch.

## What I Learned
- **Organizing Nested List Information**: Using nested lists to organize related information (event names and details) made the structure cleaner and more intuitive.
- **Using Padding and Margins for Consistent Spacing**: Adjusting padding and margin in the `.event-details` class helped maintain a consistent and attractive layout.

## Challenges I Faced and How I Overcame Them
1. **Aligning Event Details Neatly**:
   - **Challenge**: Ensuring the event details were consistently aligned under each event was initially tricky.
   - **Solution**: I applied `padding-left: 20px;` and `margin: 0 0 20px 30px;` to `.event-details`, which aligned the details neatly without overcrowding.

2. **Hover Effect Consistency**:
   - **Challenge**: The hover effect wasn’t applying consistently to the `.event` class.
   - **Solution**: I reviewed CSS for specificity and confirmed class names were correct, which ensured the hover effect worked as expected.
